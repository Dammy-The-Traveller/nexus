# Laravel Job Portal

This is a Laravel-based web application that allows employers to manage jobs efficiently. Employers can create accounts, log in, post job listings, edit or delete them, and utilize various robust Laravel features. The application also incorporates essential security measures and developer conveniences like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), factories, seeders, and CSRF protection.

## Features

### Employer Functionality
- **Account Management**: Employers can create accounts and log in securely.
- **Job Management**:
  - Create new job postings.
  - Edit existing job postings.
  - Delete job postings when no longer needed.

### Developer Tools
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enables live reloading during development for a seamless coding experience.
- **Factories and Seeders**: 
  - Use factories to quickly scaffold sample data for testing purposes.
  - Seeders populate the database with initial data for development and testing.
  
### Security Features
- **CSRF Protection**: Ensures that only authorized forms can submit data to the application.
- **Session Hijacking Prevention**: Implements measures to protect user sessions from being stolen or misused.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laravel-job-portal.git
   cd laravel-job-portal
 2. **Install dependencies**:
     ```bash
    composer install
    npm install

3. **Set up environment file**:
    .Copy the example .env file
   ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
  .Update the .env file with your database credentials and other settings.

4. **Run migrations and seed the database**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve

6. **Run Vite for HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
##Usage
1. Visit the application in your browser (default: http://localhost:8000).
2. Create an employer account and log in.
3. Use the dashboard to create, edit, and delete job postings.
4. Test security features like CSRF protection by trying invalid form submissions.
#Testing
 1. **Run automated tests**:
    ```bash
    php artisan test

2. **Use factories for test data**:
   .Generate sample jobs, employers, or other entities using Laravel factories.
   .**Example**:
   ```php
    Job::factory()->count(10)->create();

##Security Considerations##
1. CSRF Protection: Enabled by default for all forms.
2. Session Hijacking Prevention:
     .Implemented via Laravel's default session management and additional middleware if needed.
